# Dataset Documentation for Insurance Fraud Anomaly Analysis

## Data Sources
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [insert data source here, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, etc.]. It contains records of insurance claims, including various features that may indicate fraudulent activity.

## Dataset Structure
The dataset consists of the following columns:

- **claim_id**: Unique identifier for each claim.
- **policy_id**: Identifier for the insurance policy.
- **claim_amount**: Total amount claimed.
- **covered_anomaly**: Indicator of whether the claim has covered anomalies (1 for yes, 0 for no).
- **document_submitted_anomaly**: Indicator of whether there are anomalies in the submitted documents.
- **benefits_anomaly**: Indicator of anomalies in the benefits claimed.
- **hospitalized_date_anomaly**: Indicator of anomalies in the dates of hospitalization.
- **claim_limit_lower_than_total_amount_anomaly**: Indicator of whether the claim limit is lower than the total amount claimed.

## Preprocessing Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values by either filling them with appropriate values or removing rows/columns with excessive missing data.
2. **Encoding**: Convert categorical variables into numerical format using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.
3. **Normalization**: Normalize numerical features to ensure they are on a similar scale, which is important for many machine learning algorithms.

## Usage
This dataset is used in conjunction with the analysis scripts and Jupyter notebooks provided in this project to detect anomalies in insurance claims and visualize the results.
